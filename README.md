Brewer's log application.

This is not a recipe designier software. It has no calculators (maybe except for some simplest ones, like ABV or SG/Plato conversion). It does not maintain any shopping lists, nor it does not provide any brewday timers. It has no concept of "inventory" or "predefined mash schedules", not to mention "equipment profile". Just enter your ingredients, describe process, add any remarks and collect all info on brew to create complete history of your brew: how it was brewed, how it tasted, how long it kept well, when went off.

This app is written by actual homebrewer for other fellow brewers.
